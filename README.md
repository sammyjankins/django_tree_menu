## Description
- Menu implemented via **template tag**.
- Everything above the selected item is expanded. The first level under the selected item is also expanded.
- The active menu item is determined based on the URL of the current page.
- To implement the logic, only **Django** and the standard **Python** libraries were used.
- **MDBootstrap** was used to display nested dropdowns.
